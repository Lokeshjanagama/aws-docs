AWS Shared Security Responsibility Model

Security OF the Cloud : AWS Responsibility
Security IN the cloud : Customer Responsibility


===========================================================================================

D: 02/08/2023

2 types of users in AWS.

--> root user : Will have unrestricted access on AWS account. (manage any service also, account management)

--> IAM user : Designed to manage user access. We can limit user access on specific services. To follow least privilages mechanism, we need to depend on this user.

Scenario : 
S3 : AWS version of GDrive : Storage Service.. : 
ec2 : Elastic compute cloud : we launch and manage servers.. 

--> Least privilages mechanism : Providing least permissions to perform his job.

Authentication : having a valid username and password 
Authorization : access on the services.


IAM user Access Types in AWS:

--> AWS management console access /gui : Browser 
--> programatic access / cli : command prompt / cdk

User creation : 

Setup username
--> choose access type
	--> Enable "console access", "Password setup", and enforce him to setup new password.
	
Setup permissions:

policy : Set of permissions on AWS environment.


IAM : FREE ALWAYS. 

Task 1 : Create an AWS account, Create a zero spend budget. 

Task 2 : Create an IAM user, Username: "s3user" and allocate "s3fullaccess" policy, Login as this user and verify his access. (navigate to s3(no error), then navigate to ec2(error)).

Task 3 : Create an IAM user, Username: "ec2user" and allocate "ec2fullaccess" policy, Login as this user and verify his access. (navigate to s3(error), then navigate to ec2( no error)).

Task 4 : Create an IAM user, Username : "yourname" and allocate "AdministratorAccess" policy, Login as this user and verify his access on s3, ec2 and iam.
--> use this user to view "billing information" of this account. allow/deny.??

try Task 4, by login as "root user". ==> allow

===========================================================================================

D: 03/08/2023

--> Policy: Document that contains set of permissions on AWS account, Writtens in JSON format.

	--> AWS Managed policy - Job function (DBA/networkadmin - full-rds, read-ec2, some perm on - s3)
	--> AWS Managed policy (based on service) - s3 (s3full, s3readon, s3lambda)
	--> Customer managed policy : you can create and manage these, based on your custom req. 

Effect : Allow / Deny
Service : s3/ec2/rds
Actions : * / (put/get/delete/list/read/write)
Resources : with in the service, we can limit to spoecifiuc resources (onebucket/db)

Requirement : I need one poliy, that can allow s3 and ec2 full.

Requirement : I need an IAM user, Who have "FullAccess" on all the services, but not on "s3".




Task : Task 4 user, not bale to view the billing information. "Allow this user to view billing information". 

Task 2 : create an IAM user, Provide him "AdministratorAccess", but dont allow him to perform anything on "s3 service".

Task 3 : Create an IAM user, Provide him "s3fullaccess", create a custom policy and associate.  Should deny "DELETE BUCKET" operation and "DELETE OBJECT".


Task 4 : Create an IAM user, Provide him "s3fullaccess", while creating policy add a condition to work only from specific Public IP address. 

183.82.125.5/32.. Now get your home network piublic ip  11.11.11.11/32 and test.

https://whatismyipaddress.com/  get your public ip and add /32 to it.


===========================================================================================

D: 04/08/2023

Conditions
Inline
Permisssions boundary
user activities
credentials report

Conditions : Help us to restrict user to access our environment from "corporate IP" only.
--> We can limit users to work only on specific region.


Inline : Alligned to one particular entity (user/role)
--> When user exceeded allowed policy attachements, we can use this inline policy.
--> We cannot attach to multiple users (we cannot reuse).
--> We cannot filter all inline polocies we have in our account.

Permissions boundary : To restrict users to max permisisons on top of his allocated permissions.

User Activities : We can use "CloudTrail" to track all IAM user activities. This service enabled by defaultly, it can store last 90 days logs. 
--> We can create a trail and store all logs in s3 bucket, we can store for unlimityed days/ we can setup retention using s3 life cycle.

Credentials Report : Help us to get all user login/password setup/expiration information.



Task : Create a Policy to allow IAM users to activate MFA themselfs.
--> Create an IAM user, Provide him  "s3fullaccess", login as this user and try to activate MFA.

Task 2 : Allow an IAM user to work only in "ap-south-1", Provide him "AdministratorAccess"
--> Login and try to create a bucket in "mumbai", should allow, any other region should deny.
